Good afternoon
I have an ecolodge in Costa Rica in the central Pacific area, between Quepos and Dominical.  I am looking for a chef entrepreneur who wants to runs his own kitchen - not tico food, but fine dining.  My location is absolutely beautiful.

More specifically I am not offering a job but a partnership into a culinary business that can profit both of us.  I have the venue, I will manage the advertisements, including web and signage.  Our target client base are expats who love fine food and dining as well as tourists.  We are conveniently located between Manuel Antonio and Dominical, and halfway from San Jose to the OSA peninsula (to attract tourists who need a great lunch).  This is a relaxed environment.  I would provide the kitchen, amenities - the 'chef' would manage the kitchen, menu and staff.  

This is a very good opportunity to be your own boss (perhaps co-boss), but the profitability is within the correct candidate's hands.  I want someone who wants to make money and a great life for themselves in Costa Rica.

Reach out with your cv and anything else you'd like to share with me about your life aspirations.

Please only respond if you are serious, and have the creds....

Ciao
Helene
